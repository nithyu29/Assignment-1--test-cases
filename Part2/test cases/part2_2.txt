crash1.gft: 

        This test case triggers a segmentation fault error. 
        It is caused by a buffer overflow in the message field of the message record type. 
        The message is 32 bytes long, but the buffer that holds it is only 31 bytes long. 
        By filling the message field with 32 bytes, the program overflows the buffer and crashes.
crash2.gft:

        This test case also triggers a segmentation fault error, but the root cause is different from crash1.gft. 
        This time, the error is caused by a null pointer dereference.
        In the interpreter function, there is a check for valid record types.
        If the record type is not recognized, the program prints an error message and exits. 
        However, in crash2.gft, the record type is set to zero, which is not recognized as a valid record type. 
        As a result, the program tries to dereference a null pointer and crashes.
hang.gft: 

        This test case triggers an infinite loop. 
        It is caused by the animation record type. 
        The program field of the record is filled with 256 bytes of end program instructions, which causes the interpreter function to loop indefinitely.
