Test Case 1: crash1.gft
This test case will cause the program to crash due to a buffer overflow.
We will create a gift card file with a merchant ID that is longer than 32 bytes.
The program will read in 32 bytes for the merchant ID and will write them to the output file.
However, our merchant ID is longer than 32 bytes and will overflow the buffer, causing a segmentation fault.



Test Case 2: crash2.gft
This test case will cause the program to crash due to a null pointer dereference.
 We will create a gift card file with a record of type "animation" but without any program instructions.
The program will try to execute the program, but it will fail to find any instructions and will attempt to dereference a null pointer, resulting in a segmentation fault.



Test Case 3: hang.gft
This test case will cause the program to loop infinitely due to a bug in the animation record type.
We will create a gift card file with a record of type "animation" that has a program with an instruction that jumps to itself.
The program will keep jumping to itself and will never terminate, causing an infinite loop.
